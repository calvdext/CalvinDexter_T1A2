My Portfolio Website, for Coder Academy Term 1 assessment 2

### Description 
This Website has been created as a professional platform to introduce myself and my skills and knowledge of HTML and CSS while simultaneously using web developing tools such as wireframes, site maps, github repo and deployment methods of the site. The site itself is a 5 page website with a Home, About Me, Blog, Resume and Contact page with a mobile first design, media queries to accommodate for screen sizes of a mobile, tablet and desktop. 
 
### Purpose
The purpose of this website is to show potential employers some of my web development skills and my personality. But for myself it’s a learning project that I feel has given me a lot of experience and knowledge of building a website from scratch. Taking time to plan and make content for this project had its benefits for the building process and having wireframes and site map to reference made this project all come together without any major issues. 

### Functionality / features
