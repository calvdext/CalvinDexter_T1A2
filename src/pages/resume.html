            <p>“Coding has become one of my newest hobbies and I’m loving it! Being such a large industry there seems like an endless supply of information and knowledge for technology. I love problem solving, brain teasers, math equations and the patterning of code. There is always something new to learn and implement. I’ve started my first student program at Coder Academy. The ability to work remotely has been very appealing to me since the recent covid pandemic also ties into wanting to travel in the future. I’m very grateful I get to experience the on campus learning experience at Codecademy” </p>

            <p>“My past Career as a Qualified Chef has taken me deep into Northern India with my brother’s idea of opening a traditional Indian restaurant. I had Two weeks of intense training with a Chef who had been making the specific food for over 30 years. It was an amazing learning experience. I’m very proud of being able to learn so much in a short period of time from guys who didn’t even speak the same language as I do. Then going on to open our own restaurant two years ago was also a lot of hard work and dedication to maintain and grow the business.”</p>
